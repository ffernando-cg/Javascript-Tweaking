Repository for all kinds of javascript projects that i do on my freetime, either following guides or code i made by myself


# AnimationPureJS Folder 
This folder is for an animation made in pure JavaScript with the following guide made by FranksLaboratory on https://youtu.be/d620nV6bp0A with the inclusion of mouse movements



# 1.0 Folder
This is a full front end proyect where i implemented both the Animation previously mentioned and the pagepilling plugin with the inclusion of JQuery and Bootstrap.
On top of that, i reduced times on code execution and made the Animation faster and more reliable for all platforms.
### Total used technologies:
* [Pure JS Animation](https://youtu.be/d620nV6bp0A) - For canvas animation.
